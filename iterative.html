        <p data-aos="fade-up">We created an interactive prototype for a mobile webpage that could help the company carry out their goals. We began with some sketches and worked through the design process to get all the way to an interactive prototype! **Note that this is a mobile webpage and not a mobile app.**</p>

                    The items in the shop are also now implemented with horizontal scroll to get rid of infinite vertical space.</p>

                    <p>- Users felt that the text on our about us page was too small, so we increased our font sizes.
                    </p>
                    <p>- Users found that our header was inconsistent across pages and elements seemed to "jump around",
                      so we standardized the header elements.</p>
                    <p>- Users felt that our navbar menu didn't have enough contrast, so we darkened the background to create
                      contrast between the text and background.</p>
                    <p>- Users felt that having product categories to the left of product elements took up to much
                      screen space on mobile, so we restructured the shop page to better fit a mobile interface.</p>
                    <p>- Because our product is specialized and niche, users wanted more information about the products
                      they were purchasing, so we added a more in depth product details page for each product.</p>
                    <p>- Users found the checkout page with all purchase information displayed at once to be
                      overwhelming, so we broke up the details by section.</p>
                    <p>- Users felt that our checkout process wasn't inclusive of more modern day payment methods, so we
                      added options for Apple Pay, PayPal, and giftcards.</p>

                    Our user testers found the color palette and image to text balance very satisfactory. One user
                    described the homepage as having an 'earthy' and 'natural' color scheme, with easy to digest
                    'bite-size bits of content'. One user thought more information could be helpful, as she was not
                    familiar with sustainable products.

                    Our incentive for this task was to see if users could easily navigate to information pages, like
                    About Us or FAQ to learn more about any questions they may have about the company or its products.
                    All users were able to do so and rated the task very easy.

                    Some users were confused that the figma prototype wasn’t fully functional and that most buttons and
                    links were not responsive. However, all users quickly and instinctively headed to the shop page and
                    clicked on the add to cart button, either directly from the shop page or from the product page,
                    which is what we were looking for.

                  <div class="accordion-body">
                    One user struggled especially with this because of dead end links that were not responsive, and did
                    not reach the order confirmation page. The other two users were able to navigate to the cart page
                    and successfully place an order.

                    Both users that were able to reach the order confirmation page responded very or fairly confident,
                    and one user responded not confident at all.

              <p><br />Overall, users had positive reviews, especially regarding the layout and color aesthetics and
                the
                navigation accessibility. One user described the prototype as buggy which hindered her from successfully
                completing all our tasks—one thing we could do is structure our tasks around the specific interactive
                components in the Figma, since users were confused that some links and buttons were not responsive. In
                terms of the interface, suggestions for improvement included more filters on the shopping page, as well
                as more product-related information in the homepage for those unfamiliar with sustainable or vegan
                products. This feedback seems reasonable and is in line with what our team expected.</p>
